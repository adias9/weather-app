You may see in my first version that I had a bug and realized it had to do with lifecycle updating and the library. I have fixed the bug even though it is after the deadline, because I hate turning in something I'm not satisfied with.  I fixed it and I am much more satisfied with the final product. I will have no more updates.

Please also add the env file with the keys I have supplied to be able to have the app function.
